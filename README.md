As large scale biochemical plate assay experimentation becomes more common, the need for a central management system for organizing, storing, and analyzing plate information is becoming more important.  The Platify Plate, Assay, and Results Management System (PARMS) provides an end-to-end solution, with a focus on providing an intuitive, feature-rich interface.  The plate editor allows rapid layout of an assay, storing plate templates for later reuse.  SAMS also provides an interactive, user-driven output parser.  A researcher can load in CSV/TSV-formatted output from a new machine, then guide SAMS through locating any and all values to be imported.  Once thatâ€™s finished, SAMS will store a machine configuration, so it can later be applied automatically to any further output from that machine.  Results can be viewed within SAMS, or downloaded for further analysis elsewhere.
