# Platify

Platify is an open-source project geared towards simplifying the setup, repeatability, results import, analysis, visualization, and sharing of data associated with liquid based bio-chemical experimentation. It is flexible enough for use with a wide range of apparatus, and geared towards the most common types of experiments which scientists perform today.

The system is easy to install and run from a lab’s group server, with the client application accessible via a web browser. This setup will support two layers of security: Software security through the application itself (username and password access), and security through controlled access and firewalls on the server, giving organizations the ability to even close the server off entirely from access outside of the lab or facility. A web application that is run on the user’s own server provides a tremendous amount of portability, ease of access, and flexible security control that makes this ideal for a lab setting.
